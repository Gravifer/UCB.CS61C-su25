This is my auditting of the course; starter repos have been merged into one, 
and you can find all starter code conveniently located at the [starter](https://github.com/Gravifer/UCB.CS61C-su25/tree/starter) branch.
To see the `61c-teach` remotes, run
```
git config --local include.path ../.gitconfig
```
